* Overview

  New screencast each week about java technologies useful for getting
  stuff done at http://javajing.com

  This github repository contains the companion source code for each
  javajing.com episode. 

* Video Encoding Notes

  I use Camtasia Studio to record screencasts. Here are the settings I
  use to export the video: 

  MP4 with H.264 encoding
  Frame Rate: 15
  Data Rate: 1024 Kbps

  Known issues: Currently, the videos don't play on Android. 

  Going to try this for android (and mobile) devices: 

  audio_bitrate: 128 (or less)
  audio_sample_rate: 44100 (or less)
  size: 480x320
  max_frame_rate: 30
  video_bitrate: 1500 (or less)
