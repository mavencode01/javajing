* JavaJing Link Checker

  This is a real world example of how quartz can be used to schedule
  and run java programs. 

  The Quartz scheduler starts a JavaJingChecker periodically. The
  JavaJingChecker uses a JavaJingScraper to connect to the http site,
  find links to all the pages and then checks to make sure we can
  connect to each page. 

** Usage

*** Database
   
    This uses an embedded h2sqldb to store results of testing whether
    pages are accessible. To create the database, cd into link-checker
    and then run: 

    #+begin_src java
    mvn -Pcreatedb compile
    #+end_src

*** Compile/Build
    
    #+begin_src sh
    mvn clean install 
    #+end_src

*** Deploy
    
    Bundle as an executable jar using:

    #+begin_src sh
    cd link-checker
    mvn -Pjar install
    #+end_src

*** Run
    
    java -jar target/linkchecker.jar
