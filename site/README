* Overview

This is the source code for the javajing.com website. 

The site is written in emacs using org-mode. The *.org
files are then processed to create the html/css/js website. Then,
those files are processed using Jekyll to create the final site.

The java webapp inside this project includes some tools to help
publishing the site from org-mode to the web.

* Steps to create the website

- First, move files into jekyll directory structure
- Next, use org-mode to convert show-notes.org files into html posts
- Finally, use Jekyll to publish the final site.
