** Serialization

   By default, Jackson looks for public getter methods and fields in
   order to convert Object into json. See documentation in the
   `SerializtionFeature` class for more info. 

   Control serialization behavior by configuring a mapper using
   `MapperFeature`, `SerializtionFeature`, and `Feature` classes

   Use the `ObjectMapper::setVisibility` method to change behavior so
   that jackson will serialize protected and private fields and
   getters as well.
